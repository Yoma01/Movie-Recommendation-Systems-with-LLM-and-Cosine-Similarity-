# Movie-Recommendation-Systems-with-LLM-and-Cosine-Similarity-
two movie recommendation systems: one utilizing a large language model (LLM) and one without, to compare performance.
The first recommendation system uses LLaMA 2 LLM which embeds movies from the Netflix Kaggle dataset into high-dimensional vectors.
The second recommendation system is a content-based system that uses cosine similarity and bag-of-words techniques to generate vectors, extracting tags for accurate movie recommendations based on similarity in description, genre, and other features.
Input like movie name or movie description can be put into both systems and the top 5 similar movies are recommended
